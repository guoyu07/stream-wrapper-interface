# README
This repository holds all interfaces defined by [streamWrapper](http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php).

An instance of this class is initialized as soon as a stream function tries to access the protocol it is associated with.

*Note:*
This is NOT a real class, only a prototype of how a class defining its own protocol should be.
